# ZamZam - Sunrise

We provide solutions and ideas about how to use emotional-aware and personality data to build more user specific recommendation systems in the field of tv recommendations. The main concept is to collect user and vital data via smart devices and social media services before, during and after tv media consumption and match the collected data with different emotional states, to recommend the ideal movie given a certain mood ("assertive state"). Due to a lack of data, we were unable, to code a complete machine learning model, however a pipeline of the conceptual model is provided. Furthermore, we conclude on how the needed data might be collected.

As an additional step, we make use of the IPFS network to allow faster access to movie content.

This project is solely used for the purposes of the Start Hack 2022.
